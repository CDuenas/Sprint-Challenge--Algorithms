#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n), It has a fixed input and only performs one operation per 'a'


b) O(n^2), There is a nested loop so n scales ^2


c)O(n), because of recursion

## Exercise II

If the building is a list of floors I would first try to break the list in half by finding the midpoint from there if you go down (left of the list) and the egg breaks you continue going down until it no longer breaks, if you go up (to the right) and it does not break you continue to go up until it breaks.

Runtime would be O(n)
